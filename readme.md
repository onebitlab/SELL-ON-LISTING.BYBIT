# üöÄ Bybit Sell on Listing Bot

This Python script automatically places a limit sell order immediately after a new token is listed on Bybit. It's built for speed, precision, and safety during high-volatility listing events.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

* **Asynchronous Execution** ‚Äî Built using `asyncio` and `asyncio.to_thread` to handle API calls without blocking, ensuring maximum responsiveness with the Bybit API.
* **Time synchronization** ‚Äî Syncs local time with Bybit's server time to avoid clock drift, using modern `datetime` practices.
* **Configurable Pre-Launch Pooling** ‚Äî Begins checking for the trading pair a specified number of seconds (`pre_launch_pooling`) before your exact `launch_time`.
* **Continuous Monitoring** ‚Äî Polls the Bybit REST API for the appearance of the trading pair at a defined `pair_check_interval`.
* **Smart Price and Quantity Calculation** ‚Äî Applies Bybit's `priceFilter` and `lotSizeFilter` to ensure your order meets exchange requirements and is not rejected.
* **Infinite Price Retrieval Retries** ‚Äî Continuously attempts to fetch the current price until successful or program interruption, with a configurable `price_check_interval` between attempts.
* **Automatic Order Cancellation** ‚Äî If the order isn't filled within a configurable `order_timeout`, it is automatically cancelled.
* **API Key Pre-Checks** ‚Äî Verifies the validity of your API key and permissions before starting the main bot logic, preventing failed operations due to misconfiguration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create a `config.py` file in the root directory:**

   ```python
   # config.py

   # BYBIT API Credentials 
   api_key = 'YOUR_BYBIT_API_KEY'          # Your Bybit API Key
   api_secret = 'YOUR_BYBIT_SECRET_KEY'    # Your Bybit Secret Key

   # Trading configuration
   pair = 'ALT/USDT'                       # Trading pair, e.g.: 'ALT/USDT'
   tokens_for_sale = '170'                 # Amount of tokens to sell (as a string)
   price_offset = '1.0'                    # Percentage below market price (e.g., '1.0' means 1% below)

   # Timing
   launch_time = '2025-06-25 10:00:00'     # Exact trading start time (UTC) in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format
   pre_launch_pooling = 10                 # Interval (in seconds) before launch_time to start checking for the pair listing
   pair_check_interval = 0.5               # Interval (in seconds) between trade pair availability checks
   price_check_interval = 1.0              # Interval (in seconds) between price retrieval attempts upon error
   order_timeout = 30                      # Cancel order after this many seconds if not filled
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: API Key Permissions

Make sure your Bybit API key has **"Read/Write"** permissions enabled for **"Spot Trading"** or **"Unified Trading Account"**.

If you encounter an `InvalidRequestError` during pre-checks, double-check your API key, secret, and any IP restrictions on your Bybit account. Ensure the key is not expired.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Simply run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## üõ† Notes

* The time format for `launch_time` must be `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` in **UTC**.
* If you launch the bot after `launch_time` has passed, it will immediately begin checking for the pair.
* The script uses `asyncio` with `asyncio.to_thread` for robust non-blocking operation with the synchronous `pybit` library.
* Order details are displayed in a readable table format using `tabulate`.
* The bot will continuously attempt to fetch the token's price until successful or interrupted, respecting the `price_check_interval`.
